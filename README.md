ðŸ‘‹ Hello,
#### Introduction-
The repository contains my solution to the Data Engineering assignment of Yara.

There are two folders - `Python` and `SQL`. Both the questions asked have been completed.
I have attached images of the successful outputs of the testcases as evidence of successful execution.

For the SQL questions, I have included the query from creation of table to inserting of rows and then to the SQL query based on the question.

####  Environment Used-

The `Python` version used by me for Python questions is `3.10`.

The `SQL` engine used by me for SQL questions is `MySQL`.

#### Test Cases - 

I have attached the images of the test cases that are present in the document to each question. 
Please refer to the images if there is any doubt in running of your code based on custom input/testing.
